Graph mining is an important data analysis methodology, but struggles as  the input graph size increases. The scalability and usability challenges posed by such large graphs make it imperative to sample the input graph and reduce its size. The critical challenge in sampling is to identify the appropriate algorithm to insure the resulting analysis does not suffer \textbf{heavily} from the data reduction.

This repository two new sampling variations for targeted graph mining applications. It presents empirical results to show that knowledge of the target application, along with input graph properties can be used to select the best sampling algorithm. 
It can be use to show that non-degree based features such as diversity and motifs perform better for dense heterogeneous graph
and the performance degradation follows a logistic function
